# GDJ #

Instead of video DJ (VDJ), this is GIF DJ (GDJ).

The idea here is to KISS, but semi-entertaining.


# How do I use this? #

Download some gifs, download the software, read the source, and go nuts.

Seriously, this isn't (and will likely never be) ready for production, so use 
at your own risk.

This awful system wouldn't of been possible without:
